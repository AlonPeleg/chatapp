This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`



there's no logout function yet.
problem with side menus while viewing on a mobile device (vertical)


Site is hosted on netlify - `https://ap-my-chat-app.netlify.app/` - no demo users at this moment due to lack of logout function.

Users / groups can be managed on https://chatengine.io/
